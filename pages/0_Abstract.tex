\textit{Industry 4.0 is an increasingly developed research subject as the prevalence of machine-learning and automation of systems grows rapidly within different economic sectors\cite{pettinger_2019}. Research into usage of 5G and edge-based services to bring real-time data-processing, storage and inferences has been growing and interest in it also. The ability to provide real-time inferences at the edge is invaluable where responsiveness of the system can lead to rapid improvements in production and processing times.}

\textit{This project works with InterDigital to develop research into deployment of machine-learning models and inference capabilities at the edge, where connections to the cloud can be limited, in conjunction with AWS and their cloud-based services. AWS being one of the major cloud-providers for many globally-reputed companies and provides many cutting edge services.}

\textit{The report then documents the successes that the team has with the Group Design Project and with the completion of the requirements as per the specification document, which was approved by InterDigital. The report also discusses in detail the project management strategies employed to ensure project success and to maximise effectiveness of the project members' abilities.}
