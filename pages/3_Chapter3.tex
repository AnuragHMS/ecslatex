% Need an introduction to the system design - referencing to system diagrams generated
Following the brief outlined in \ref{0_2_project_brief}, the system diagram shown in Figure \ref{fig_system_diagram_full} allows the system to be split into three different stages, with a fourth stage for any application derived from the data and from any classifications made by the ML Model developed. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data Collection and Transformation
    \item Localised Processing, Storage and Classification
    \item Cloud Based Processing, Storage and Inference
    \item Over-the-top Application using ML Model Outputs and Input Data
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

From these 4 stages, the system design can be understood. All data is collected from the access point, which for this project is ASUS Rog AX11000 Router, which is connected to a laptop and is responsible for data retrieval. The laptop in this wireless pipeline is an end-user connected to some access-point. The project then explores data transportation through several data pipe-lining methods..
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data is sent directly to the cloud from the Laptop after data is compressed into a smaller and better format for transport.
    \item Data is sent to a local Edge Node containing processing and ML models to process data and all analytics and results are computed direclty on the Edge Node.
    \item Data is sent to the cloud from the laptop via the Edge Node. Comparisons in latency of response can easily be drawn from this.
\end{itemize}

In the following few sections, the report will explore each of these stages metnionted above as well as how data will be processed in each pipeline path.
