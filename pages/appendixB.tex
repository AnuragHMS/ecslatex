[Problem Description]\\
Subject:Wi-Fi Analysis Tool\\

To whom it may concern,

I am an MEng Electronics Engineering student at the University of Southampton, currently working on a Wireless Telemetry data collection and Machine Learning group project. For this project I am using the ASUS ROG GT-AX11000router and more specifically the Wi-Fi Radar analysis tool to collect data from the router. Having exported the database generated through the Wi-Fi Radar analysis tool, I am now required to understand all the data collected. Having looked through the user manual for the router I could not find any information on the data tables and column header generated by analysis tool. I am emailing to ask for more documentation on this analysis tool or more information on the parameters recorded. Please could you assist with this enquiry as soon as possible, and I look forward to hearing from you. 

Thanks,

Akshay Nair
